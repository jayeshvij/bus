# âœ… All Issues Fixed!

## Issues Resolved

### 1. âœ… **Removed Route/Stop Duplication**
   **Problem:** Routes and stops were showing duplicates across all pages
   
   **Solution:**
   - Fixed `getAllRoutes()` method to sort routes by `stop_order`
   - Each route now displays stops in correct order without duplicates
   - Used unique keys: `${stop.route_number}-${stop.stop_order}`

### 2. âœ… **Fixed Notifications System**
   **Problem:** Notifications weren't working properly
   
   **Solution:**
   - Notifications are now stored in-memory properly
   - Driver notifications only go to students on that specific route
   - Admin broadcasts go to all users
   - Students see notifications for their assigned route + admin broadcasts
   - Refresh button manually reloads notifications

### 3. âœ… **One-Time Stop Selection (Permanent)**
   **Problem:** User could change stop multiple times
   
   **Solution:**
   - User selects pickup stop **ONCE** at first login
   - Selection is permanently stored in user data
   - **No "Change Stop" button** - selection is final
   - Stop info stored in: `selected_stop_name` and `selected_stop_time`

### 4. âœ… **Simpler, Collapsible Pickup Selection**
   **Problem:** Pickup selection interface was too large
   
   **Solution:**
   - **Compact design** - all 4 routes in single view
   - **Collapsible routes** - click to expand/collapse each route
   - Shows route header with stop count
   - Expand to see all stops in a scrollable grid (2 columns on desktop)
   - Small, clean stop cards with essential info only
   - Much less screen space used

### 5. âœ… **Removed All Popups**
   **Problem:** Alert popups were intrusive
   
   **Solution:**
   - All `alert()` calls removed
   - Actions complete silently
   - Clean, non-intrusive experience
